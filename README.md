A template repository for trying out [bun, an incredibly faster JS runtime](https://bun.sh), on development containers with [GitHub Codespaces or VS Code - Remote Containers locally](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/#readme).

> If you already have a dev container, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.
